# MDA_Clicker
This project consists of the creation of an idle game, i.e. an incremental game that does not require great skills from the user except for the repetition of simple actions in which the user obtains points that can then be invested in improving the rewards of these actions.
To develop this project, the famous Cookie Clicker has been used as a reference, although changing the theme of biscuits for paper rolls.
